## Hi 👋 I’m Tarun

I'm a technology leader and enthusiast with 30+ years of experience, passionate about building and scaling solutions with AI. I thrive on leading teams, crafting code, and helping startups and enterprises grow through innovative technology. I also enjoy building side projects in my free time. I'm always tinkering with something new especially in AI.

Previously, I kept everything on my local PC so some of the projects trace back a few years. Now, I’ve switched to GitHub to share my work, collaborate with the community, and showcase my journey. 

### Things I'm currently experimenting 🔭 with:
- Auto-tuning models as a basis for an auto-tuning agent
- Recently released open source Chatterbox which lights a fire under ElevenLabs
- Agents and Agentic workflows
- Zero code - V0
- Generative picture and video generation - Stable Diffusion models and ComfyUI workflows
